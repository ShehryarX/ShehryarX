### Hi I'm Shehryar ðŸ‘‹ 3A Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo
![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=adichha)

ðŸŒŽ I'm passionate about writing code and developing software that makes a positive impact in the world. Some of my projects include an SMS based service that uses blockchain to facilitate micro financing for small economies and a platform that allows small businesses to economically collect statistics in order to save money and optimize their workflows.

ðŸ”­I'm currently looking for a Summer 2021 SWE internship and am always happy to connect!
